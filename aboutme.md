As a faculty member in the Center for Bioinformatics, Department of Public Health Sciences, Henry Ford Health System, my research focuses on understanding how specific genetic risk variants and environmental factors influence gene regulatory mechanisms and contribute to development of complex, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. I have developed and implemented novel statistical and machine learning techniques to elucidate the genetic basis of complex diseases, including colon cancer, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren’s syndrome, sarcoidosis, and multiple sclerosis. I have been involved in multiple projects where I performed analyses for complex diseases using large-scale, high-throughput genetic, genomic, and clinical data. Through these studies, I have served as a lead or contributing author on multiple manuscripts published in Nature Genetics, Arthritis & Rheumatology, PLOS ONE, and Cancer Research, among others. My goal is to combine multiple data types through novel statistical and informatics approaches to elucidate previously undetectable relationships between genes, environmental factors, and diseases or phenotypes.

### Research Interests:
My research interests include both traditional and advanced statistics, statistical genetics and genomics, biostatistics, bioinformatics, genetic epidemiology, admixture mapping, next-generation sequencing data analysis (DNA-seq, RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and ATAC-seq, among others), multi-omics data integration, network modeling, data mining, and machine learning.
